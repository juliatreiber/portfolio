        <span id="bubble3" class="bubbles">
            I ain't so sure of that, Torchie. Is it my imagination...
        </span>
        <span id="bubble4" class="bubbles">
            ...or does <strong>Galactus</strong> look... smaller?
        </span>
        <span id="bubble5" class="bubbles">
            It's not imagination, Ben. <strong>Galactus</strong> is using his energy reserves faster than his body can replenish them. He's actually dwindling in size.
